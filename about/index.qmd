::: {#about-me}
I am a 4th year PhD student in the Quantitative Methods program of the Department of Psychology at York University.

I am interested in the powerful and insightful application of quantitative analysis towards psychological data for scientific purposes.

My research currently focuses on:

1.  The effects of cluster size in multilevel/hierarchical models

2.  The development of fast and robust Integrated Generalized Structured Component Analysis Trees (IGSCA-Trees) in the R package [*cSEM*](https://github.com/FloSchuberth/cSEM)

3.  Using philosophy of science, psychology and statistics to provide a justification for the application of machine-learning structural equation modeling methods called 'Falsificatory Data Analysis'

Please feel free to reach out to me!
